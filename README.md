# Hacking tools
This repository contains all of the tools I've created while learning.

Also some wordlist, and other useful things that I don't know where to put.

## Python
- [A *ready-to-use* Python template](./python/all_in_one.py), self-contained, with everything ready to be executed!

## Links
All links that I found interesting.

Sometimes, I also download the page(s) in case I really want the content and expect the website to be down.

## Miscellaneous
- [A french keyboard mapping](./miscellaneous/keymap_fr.json) written in json to be easily imported by any language.
This file contains the mapping between the scan codes and their ascii representation.
I used this mapping during the resolution of keylogger challenges.
This list is incomplete and more data can be found [here](https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/legion/kbd/+/1.10/data/keymaps/i386/azerty/fr-latin9.map).
Also, the [same mapping](./miscellaneous/keymap_fr.py) can be found directly for Python.
